			My name is Luis Cedillo. I'm 18 years old and welcome to my website for AP Computer Science Principles. A little about myself: I have a younger brother. We live together with my mom in an apartment in southern California.
			I want to study to become a computer engineer. I've worked with computers for a long time. I built my first desktop when I was 14 and have been wanting to experiment more with computers ever since. Although, video games are
			always a constant distractor. Currently some of my favorites to play are osu! and League of Legends. I have a little programming experience, mainly with HTML and CSS but it is very rudimentary. I've also worked with C++ and
			visual basic but like with my experience with HTML it is at a beginner level.
